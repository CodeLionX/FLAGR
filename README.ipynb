    "FLAGR is a high performing, modular library for rank aggregation. To ensure the highest possible performance, the core FLAGR library is written in C++ and implements a wide collection of unsupervised rank aggregation methods. Its modular design allows third-party programmers to implement their own algorithms and easily rebuild the entire library. FLAGR can be built as a standard application, or as a shared library (`so` or `dll`). In the second case, it can be linked from other C/C++ programs, or even from programs written in other languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.).\n",

    "`Query/Topic,Voter,Item,Score,Algorithm/Dataset`\n",

This means that each element appears exactly once in each list. However, the same element may appear in lists submitted by other voters.\n",
    "* `Score`: the score assigned to an `Item` by a specific `Voter`. In may cases (e.g. search engine rankings), the individual scores are unknown. In such cases the scores can be replaced by the (reverse) ranking of an `Item` in such a manner that the top rankings receive higher scores than the ones that have been assigned lower rankings.\n",

    "* either by forwarding the name and the location of the aforementioned input CSV file (this is the `input_file` argument of the `aggregate` method),\n",
